# Comparison of Supervised Classification Algorithms

The goal for this project is to compare different supervised classification algorithms (k nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and random forest) on different datasets. I look to find an optimal solutions for a given classifier on a given dataset by tuning the hyperparameters of that classifier with the goal of achieving the highest accuracy. This was a project for my COGS 118A course at UCSD.

A report summarizing my findings is located in the repository under the title "COGS_118A_Final_Paper.pdf".

A graded copy of the report is also attached in the repository under the title "Graded_COGS_118A_Final_Paper.pdf".
